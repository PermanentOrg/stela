          A successful login - the email and password were correct. If two-factor authentication is
          required, the response will include `twoFactorId` and `twoFactorMethods`. Otherwise, it will include
          `authenticationToken`, `refreshToken`, and `account`. The `result` field can be used to determine
          whether the login is complete or if two-factor authentication is required.

      Requires authentication when adding or deleting an MFA method, but not during login (since at that point the
      user is not yet authenticated).
